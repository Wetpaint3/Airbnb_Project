# Airbnb_Project
This Project explores the factors that have the most impact on occupancy rate and profitability in Airbnb housing market in New York City. My partner and I cleaned the data and built several regression models for two dependent variables, Price and Occupancy rate, to explain and estimate the main determinants that contribute to the Price and Occupancy rate on New York City Airbnb housing. Then we have tested our model performance on Los Angeles Airbnb data to check how good our models can be generalized on completely different Airbnb housing market.
